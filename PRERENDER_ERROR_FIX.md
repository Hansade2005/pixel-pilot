# Pre-rendering Error Fix - Documentation Pages

## Problem
Next.js 15 build was failing with the following error:
```
Error occurred prerendering page "/docs/getting-started/concepts"
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The `Navigation` component is a Client Component (has `"use client"` directive)
2. It contains multiple event handlers (`onClick`, state management, etc.)
3. When imported into Server Component pages, Next.js 15 cannot serialize these event handlers during the build/prerendering phase
4. Next.js 15 has stricter rules about Client Components in Server Components during SSR

## Solution
Added `"use client"` directive to documentation pages that import the `Navigation` component:

### Files Fixed
1. **`app/docs/getting-started/concepts/page.tsx`** ✓
   - Added `"use client"` at the top of the file
   
2. **`app/docs/getting-started/quick-start/page.tsx`** ✓
   - Added `"use client"` at the top of the file

### Files Already Correct
- `app/docs/page.tsx` - Already had `"use client"`
- `app/docs/[slug]/page.tsx` - Already had `"use client"`
- `app/docs_new/page.tsx` - Already had `"use client"`

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works
When a page component is marked as a Client Component with `"use client"`:
- It runs on the client side after hydration
- Event handlers can be passed and serialized properly
- No prerendering serialization issues occur
- The page still benefits from Next.js optimization

### Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)
1. **Split Navigation into Server/Client parts** - Would require major refactoring
2. **Remove onClick handlers from Links** - Would break navigation functionality
3. **Use router.push instead of onClick** - Still requires client-side logic

## Verification Steps
1. Check that both files now start with `"use client"`
2. Verify no TypeScript/ESLint errors in the modified files
3. Run `npm run build` to ensure prerendering succeeds
4. Test navigation functionality in browser

## Related Components
- `components/navigation.tsx` - Client Component with event handlers
- `components/footer.tsx` - Client Component
- All doc pages should be Client Components when using interactive Navigation

## Best Practices Going Forward
- Any page that imports the `Navigation` component must be a Client Component
- Add `"use client"` at the very top of the file (before any imports)
- Consider creating a layout wrapper for docs if more pages are added

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Build should now succeed without prerendering errors
