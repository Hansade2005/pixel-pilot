### 2. Storage Preview Modal Mobile Enhancements

#### Header Improvements
- **Mobile-Responsive Layout**:
  - Changed from horizontal to vertical stack on mobile (`flex-col sm:flex-row`)
  - File name and metadata stack properly on small screens
  - Improved text sizing: `text-xs sm:text-sm` for better readability
  - Removed action buttons from header (moved to footer)

#### Content Area Fixes
- **Overflow Prevention**:
  - Changed container to use `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-auto` for proper flex behavior
  - Image preview: Uses `max-w-full max-h-full` to fit within container
  - PDF preview: Uses full height with `h-full` instead of fixed calculations
  - Reduced padding on mobile: `p-2 sm:p-4` for more content space
  - All content now properly constrained within modal bounds

#### Footer Enhancements
- **Action Buttons Moved to Footer**:
  - Copy URL and Download buttons relocated from header to footer
  - Buttons positioned after the expiration notice
  - Mobile layout: Full-width buttons in horizontal arrangement
  - Desktop layout: Compact buttons with text labels
  - Responsive button text: Icon-only on mobile, text + icon on desktop

- **Improved Layout Structure**:
  - Footer uses `flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive stacking
  - Expiration notice takes full width on mobile
  - Button container uses `justify-end` for proper alignment
  - Buttons use `flex-1 sm:flex-none` for equal width on mobile

#### Files Modified
- `components/database/storage-manager.tsx`:
  - Updated DialogContent with flex column layout (line ~607)
  - Made header responsive with mobile stacking (line ~609-617)
  - Fixed content area overflow (line ~619)
  - Improved image container responsiveness (line ~621-637)
  - Fixed PDF iframe height (line ~639-651)
  - Restructured footer with action buttons (line ~688-708)

## Technical Details

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Uses Tailwind's `sm:` breakpoint (640px) for responsive behavior
- Mobile-first approach: Default styles for mobile, `sm:` for desktop

### CSS Classes Used
- **Flexbox Layout**: `flex flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive stacking
- **Overflow Control**: `overflow-auto`, `max-h-[calc(100vh-80px)]`, `min-h-0`
- **Spacing**: `gap-2`, `p-2 sm:p-4` for mobile-optimized spacing
- **Sizing**: `flex-1`, `max-w-full`, `max-h-full`, `h-full`
- **Text Responsiveness**: `text-xs sm:text-sm`

### Icon Usage
- Database icon consistently used across desktop and mobile
- Icons hide text on mobile for space: `sm:mr-2` and `hidden sm:inline`
