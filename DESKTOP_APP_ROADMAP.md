# Desktop IDE Application: Development Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a new desktop IDE application, inspired by Cursor IDE. The application will be built using Electron and Vite, leveraging existing components and architecture from the current web-based project.

**Core Features:**
- A VS Code-like multi-tab code editor.
- An integrated file explorer powered by `file-explorer` and `storage-manager.ts`.
- A right-hand sidebar chat panel using `chat-panel-v2.tsx`.
- An integrated preview panel.
- A familiar authentication system with a new walkthrough welcome screen.

## 2. Core Technologies

- **Framework:** Electron with Electron Forge
- **Bundler:** Vite
- **Frontend:** React (using existing `.tsx` components)
- **Storage:** IndexedDB via `storage-manager.ts`
- **Backend Logic:** Ported from `chat-v2/route.ts`

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Core Structure

- **Task 1.1: Initialize Project:**
  - Create a new Electron project using the `vite` template.
  - Command: `npx create-electron-app my-ide --template=vite`
- **Task 1.2: Configure Electron Forge:**
  - Set up `forge.config.ts` with the necessary makers for Windows, macOS, and Linux distribution.
- **Task 1.3: Main Window & Layout:**
  - Create the main application window.
  - Implement the primary 3-column layout structure:
    - **Left Sidebar:** For File Explorer and Preview icons.
    - **Main Content Area:** For the code editor.
    - **Right Sidebar:** For the chat panel.

### Phase 2: Integrating Existing Components & Logic

- **Task 2.1: File System & Storage:**
  - Integrate `storage-manager.ts` for IndexedDB operations within the Electron environment.
  - Port and integrate the `file-explorer` component into the left sidebar.
- **Task 2.2: Code Editor:**
  - Integrate the base `code-editor` component into the main content area.
  - Initially, it will support opening and editing single files.
- **Task 2.3: Chat Panel & AI:**
  - Port the backend logic from `chat-v2/route.ts` to run in the Electron main process or a dedicated worker.
  - Integrate the `chat-panel-v2.tsx` component into the right sidebar.
  - Connect the chat panel to the backend logic.
  - Port the `ai-provider` and `ai-models` architecture.

### Phase 3: Authentication & User Onboarding

- **Task 3.1: Welcome Screen:**
  - Design and implement a walkthrough screen that highlights the app's features.
  - Add "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons.
- **Task 3.2: Authentication Integration:**
  - Adapt the existing web authentication system to work within the Electron app (handling redirects and session management).
- **Task 3.3: Workspace Loading:**
  - Implement logic to bypass the welcome screen and load the main IDE workspace if the user is already authenticated.

### Phase 4: Feature Expansion & UI/UX Polish

- **Task 4.1: Multi-Tab Code Editor:**
  - Extend the `code-editor` to support a multi-tab interface, allowing users to have multiple files open simultaneously.
- **Task 4.2: Integrated Preview:**
  - Adapt the existing `preview` component for the desktop environment.
  - Add the "eye" icon to the left sidebar to toggle the preview in a new editor tab.
- **Task 4.3: Collapsible Chat Panel:**
  - Add the "AI" icon to the top-right of the application.
  - Implement the functionality to toggle the visibility of the right sidebar chat panel.
- **Task 4.4: UI Refinements:**
  - Polish the overall UI, including icons, layout spacing, and transitions, to align with the Cursor IDE aesthetic.

### Phase 5: Advanced IDE and AI Features

- **Task 5.1: Integrated Terminal:**
  - Implement a fully functional integrated terminal within the IDE.
- **Task 5.2: Git Integration:**
  - Develop a source control view to manage Git repositories.
  - Implement basic Git commands (commit, push, pull, branch, merge) through the UI.
  - Integrate a visual diff viewer for comparing file changes.
- **Task 5.3: Debugging Tools:**
  - Implement core debugging functionalities: breakpoints, step-through execution, variable inspection, and call stack viewing.
  - Integrate with common language debuggers.
- **Task 5.4: Global Search and Replace:**
  - Implement functionality to search and replace text across multiple files in the workspace.
- **Task 5.5: Code Snippets/Templates:**
  - Develop a system for managing and inserting code snippets and templates.
- **Task 5.6: Keybinding Customization:**
  - Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts through a dedicated settings interface.
- **Task 5.7: Extensions/Plugins System:**
  - (Long-term) Design and implement a basic framework for an extensions/plugins system.
- **Task 5.8: Inline AI Code Completion:**
  - Integrate AI-powered, context-aware code completion directly into the editor.
- **Task 5.9: AI Code Refactoring/Generation:**
  - Implement AI-driven features like "Explain Code," "Generate Tests," and "Refactor Selection."
- **Task 5.10: AI-Powered Search:**
  - Enhance the global search with AI to understand natural language queries.

### Phase 6: Build & Distribution

- **Task 6.1: Build Configuration:**
  - Finalize the `electron-forge` configuration for building production-ready installers.
- **Task 6.2: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:**
  - Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate building and packaging of the application for different platforms upon code pushes or releases.
- **Task 6.3: Application Packaging:**
  - Generate installers and packages for Windows (`.exe`), macOS (`.dmg`), and Linux (`.deb`/`.rpm`).
- **Task 6.4: Auto-Updates:**
  - (Optional) Implement an auto-update mechanism to keep the application up-to-date.

### Phase 7: Testing & Debugging

- **Task 7.1: End-to-End Testing:**
  - Thoroughly test all application features, from file editing to chat functionality and authentication.
- **Task 7.2: Performance Optimization:**
  - Profile the application and optimize for performance, especially memory usage and startup time.
- **Task 7.3: Bug Fixing:**
  - Address any bugs or issues identified during the testing phase.
