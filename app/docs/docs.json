                "content": "PiPilot enforces a rigorous set of professional development standards that ensure all generated code meets enterprise-grade quality requirements, setting it apart from other development platforms. These standards are divided into TypeScript/JavaScript rules and code quality requirements, each designed to promote maintainable, scalable, and high-performance web applications. The TypeScript/JavaScript rules begin with zero tolerance for any type, mandating explicit type annotations for all variables, function parameters, and return values. This strict typing approach eliminates potential runtime errors and improves code reliability, making applications more robust and easier to refactor. Strict component typing is enforced through proper interfaces, ensuring that React components are well-defined with clear prop types and state structures. Import statements are written without semicolons and must use single quotes, maintaining consistency with modern JavaScript conventions. Component naming follows PascalCase for consistency and readability, while utility functions and variables use camelCase to distinguish their roles. JSX syntax adheres to best practices, with self-closing tags for components without children and the exclusive use of className instead of class to avoid conflicts with JavaScript's reserved keywords. The code quality requirements include a comprehensive syntax validation checklist that must be passed before any code is submitted, catching potential issues early in the development process. Import and export validation ensures proper dependency management, preventing circular dependencies and ensuring that all required modules are correctly imported. Console.log statements are strictly prohibited in production code, encouraging the use of proper logging libraries and debugging tools instead. Proper error boundaries and exception handling are mandatory, ensuring that applications gracefully handle unexpected errors and provide meaningful user feedback. These standards extend to all aspects of development, including proper code formatting, consistent indentation, and adherence to established naming conventions. PiPilot's AI assistant actively enforces these standards during code generation, automatically correcting violations and suggesting improvements.
