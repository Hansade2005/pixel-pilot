# User Request
"${prompt}"

# Your Task
Analyze the user's request and create:
1. **Project Name**: A catchy, professional, and memorable name
2. **Description**: A detailed, clear explanation of what the application does

# Project Name Guidelines

**Style Principles:**
- **Memorable**: Easy to remember and pronounce
- **Professional**: Suitable for a real product
- **Relevant**: Reflects the app's purpose or key feature
- **Unique**: Avoid generic names like "App Builder" or "My Tool"
- **Modern**: Use contemporary naming conventions

**Naming Patterns to Consider:**
- **Compound words**: TaskFlow, DataSync, CodeCraft, MindMap
- **Portmanteau**: Combining words (Snapchat = Snap + Chat, Pinterest = Pin + Interest)
- **Descriptive + Pro/Hub/Kit/Lab**: AnalyticsPro, DesignHub, BuildKit, CodeLab
- **Action-based**: TrackIt, ShipFast, BuildRight, MoveOn
- **Metaphorical**: Compass (navigation), Atlas (maps), Beacon (guidance)
- **Single word**: Notion, Slack, Discord, Stripe (if appropriate)
- **Playful suffixes**: -ly, -ify, -io, -hub, -base, -wise

**Avoid:**
- Generic terms: "The App", "My Project", "Web App"
- Overly long names: Keep it concise and punchy
- Hard to spell names: Should be intuitive
- Trendy misspellings unless intentional: "Taskr", "Buildr" (use sparingly)
- Names that are too similar to existing major products

**Character Limit**: Maximum 30 characters (strictly enforce)

**Examples of GOOD names:**
- Expense tracking ‚Üí "SplitWise" or "ExpenseFlow"
- Recipe finder ‚Üí "ChefMate" or "RecipeRadar"
- Code editor ‚Üí "CodeCanvas" or "DevStudio"
- Analytics dashboard ‚Üí "MetricHub" or "DataPulse"

# Description Guidelines

**Structure:**
Start with what the app IS, then explain key features and benefits.

**Formula**: [App Type] that [primary function] with [key features/benefits]

**Content Requirements:**
- **Opening**: Clearly state what type of application it is
- **Core Function**: Explain the main purpose/problem it solves
- **Key Features**: Mention 2-4 standout features that make it valuable
- **User Benefit**: Imply or state how it helps users
- **Technical Context** (if relevant): Mention if it uses AI, real-time sync, etc.

**Style:**
- **Clear and specific**: No vague language
- **Professional tone**: Business-appropriate
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what users can DO
- **Feature-rich**: Show the app's capabilities
- **Concise**: Every word counts

**Character Limit**: Maximum 200 characters (strictly enforce)

**Examples of GOOD descriptions:**
- "A collaborative task management platform with real-time updates, deadline tracking, progress visualization, and team communication features for remote teams."
- "An AI-powered recipe recommendation engine that suggests meals based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and nutritional goals with shopping list generation."
- "A cryptocurrency portfolio tracker with live price updates, profit/loss analytics, multi-wallet support, and automated tax reporting for investors."

**Examples of BAD descriptions:**
- "An app for tasks" (too vague)
- "The best project management tool ever made" (subjective, not descriptive)
- "A web application" (doesn't say what it does)
- "Helps users manage their stuff better" (unclear what "stuff" means)

# Analysis Process

1. **Parse the user request**: Identify the core app concept
2. **Extract key features**: What functionalities are mentioned or implied?
3. **Identify the target user**: Who will use this app?
4. **Determine the value proposition**: What problem does it solve?
5. **Consider technical aspects**: Does it use AI, real-time features, APIs, etc.?
6. **Choose naming strategy**: Which naming pattern fits best?
7. **Craft the description**: Follow the formula and include essential details

# Special Considerations

**For AI-powered apps:**
- Consider names with: Mind, Brain, Smart, Genius, AI, Neural, etc.
- Mention "AI-powered" or "intelligent" in description
- Highlight what the AI does (generates, analyzes, recommends, predicts)

**For real-time/collaborative apps:**
- Consider names with: Sync, Live, Connect, Together, Team, etc.
- Mention "real-time", "collaborative", "live updates" in description
- Emphasize teamwork or synchronization features

**For productivity tools:**
- Consider names with: Flow, Track, Manage, Organize, Plan, etc.
- Focus on efficiency, organization, time-saving in description
- Highlight workflow improvements

**For creative tools:**
- Consider names with: Create, Design, Craft, Build, Studio, etc.
- Emphasize creative possibilities in description
- Mention customization or flexibility

**For data/analytics apps:**
- Consider names with: Metric, Data, Insight, Analytics, Pulse, etc.
- Highlight visualization, tracking, or reporting in description
- Mention data sources or integration capabilities

**For e-commerce/marketplace apps:**
- Consider names with: Market, Shop, Store, Trade, Commerce, etc.
- Mention buyer/seller features, payments, inventory in description
- Highlight what makes the marketplace unique
