## 🧪 How to Test (Step by Step)

### Test 1: Verify Workspace Type Detection

1. **Open PiPilot** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
3. **Navigate to the test workspace** (ID: `403c03be-e4d1-43de-80c7-f249796c47b7`)
4. **Look for console logs:**
   ```
   [ChatPanelV2] Workspace type detected: team
   [Team Workspace Sync] Setting up realtime for workspace: 403c03be-e4d1-43de-80c7-f249796c47b7
   [Team Workspace Sync] Subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
   ```
5. ✅ **Success:** Console shows "team" workspace type

---

### Test 2: Create File in Team Workspace

1. **In the chat**, type:
   ```
   Create a hello.ts file with a simple hello world function
   ```
2. **Watch console for:**
   ```
   [StorageManager] Creating file in TEAM workspace: /hello.ts
   ```
3. **Check Network tab:**
   - Should see `POST /api/teams/workspaces/403c03be-e4d1-43de-80c7-f249796c47b7/files`
   - Response should contain the new file

4. **Verify in Supabase:**
   ```sql
   SELECT files FROM team_workspaces
   WHERE id = '403c03be-e4d1-43de-80c7-f249796c47b7';
   ```
   - Should see the hello.ts file in the JSONB array

5. ✅ **Success:** File created via API, stored in Supabase

---

### Test 3: Real-Time Collaboration (Two Browser Tabs)

1. **Open PiPilot in TWO browser tabs** (or use incognito for 2nd)
2. **Navigate both to the team workspace:** `403c03be-e4d1-43de-80c7-f249796c47b7`
3. **In Tab 1, create a file:**
   ```
   Create index.html with a simple page
   ```
4. **Watch Tab 2:**
   - Should see toast notification: "Workspace Updated"
   - File should appear in file explorer automatically
   - Console log: `[Team Workspace Sync] Workspace updated`

5. ✅ **Success:** Real-time sync working!

---

### Test 4: Edit File in Team Workspace

1. **In file explorer, click on a file**
2. **Edit the content**
3. **Save**
4. **Watch console:**
   ```
   [StorageManager] Updating file in TEAM workspace: /hello.ts
   ```
5. **Check Network tab:**
   - Should see `PATCH /api/teams/workspaces/.../files/[fileId]`

6. ✅ **Success:** File updates go to Supabase

---

### Test 5: Personal Workspace Still Works

1. **Create a new personal workspace**
2. **Add a file**
3. **Watch console:**
   ```
   [StorageManager] Creating file in PERSONAL workspace: /test.ts
   ```
4. **Verify:**
   - No API calls to team routes
   - File saved to IndexedDB
   - Cloud sync to user_backups table

5. ✅ **Success:** Personal workspaces unaffected!

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Cursors** - Can see file changes, but not where others are typing (Phase 4)
2. **No Conflict Resolution** - Last write wins (Phase 4)
3. **No File Locking** - Multiple users can edit same file (Phase 4)
4. **No Invitation System** - Must manually add users via SQL (Phase 3)
5. **No Team UI** - Need to navigate by workspace ID (Phase 3)

**All limitations are NON-CRITICAL and can be added incrementally!**

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Personal Workspace (Unchanged):
- File read: ~1-5ms (IndexedDB)
- File write: ~5-10ms (IndexedDB)
- Offline: ✅ Yes
- Cloud sync: Every 5 seconds (throttled)

### Team Workspace (New):
- File read: ~50-200ms (Supabase API)
- File write: ~100-300ms (Supabase API + activity log)
- Realtime sync: ~50-100ms (Supabase Realtime)
- Offline: ❌ No (requires connection)

**Acceptable performance for collaboration!**

## 🎓 How It Works (For Developers)

### 1. Workspace Type Detection
```typescript
// storage-manager.ts
async getWorkspaceType(workspaceId: string): Promise<'personal' | 'team'> {
  // 1. Check cache
  if (this.workspaceTypeCache.has(workspaceId)) return cached

  // 2. Try IndexedDB (personal workspaces)
  const personal = await this.storage!.getWorkspace(workspaceId)
  if (personal && !personal.organizationId) return 'personal'

  // 3. Check Supabase (team workspaces)
  const response = await fetch(`/api/teams/workspaces/${workspaceId}/type`)
  return response.isTeam ? 'team' : 'personal'
}
```

### 2. Transparent File Operations
```typescript
// storage-manager.ts
async createFileTeamAware(file) {
  const type = await this.getWorkspaceType(file.workspaceId)

  if (type === 'team') {
    // Route to API
    return await this.createTeamWorkspaceFile(file)
  } else {
    // Route to IndexedDB
    return await this.storage!.createFile(file)
  }
}
```

### 3. Real-Time Sync
```typescript
// use-team-workspace-sync.ts
supabase
  .channel(`workspace:${workspaceId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'UPDATE',
    table: 'team_workspaces',
    filter: `id=eq.${workspaceId}`
  }, (payload) => {
    // Another user edited!
    toast({ title: 'Workspace updated by teammate' })
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('team-workspace-updated', { detail: payload }))
  })
  .subscribe()
```
