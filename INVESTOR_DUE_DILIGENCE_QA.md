# 📋 PiPilot - Investor Due Diligence Preparation (2026)

## **What VCs Will Ask (& Your Answers)**

---

## **MARKET & TRACTION**

### Q: How big is your user base? What's your MRR?
**Answer Template:**
"We're at [X] active users with [Y] paying customers. Our MRR is $[Z] with [W]% month-over-month growth. We're focused on quality over vanity metrics—our customers are serious developers and indie hackers willing to pay for reliability."

**If early:** "We're validating product-market fit with early adopters. Our key metric is NPS (likely 50+), not raw user count. We're proving that serious developers will pay premium prices for reliable tools."

---

### Q: Who are your customers?
**Answer:** "Primarily indie hackers ($20-100k annual spend), SMB dev teams (2-10 devs, $500-2k monthly), and early-stage startups building MVPs. Beachhead segment: developers frustrated with Lovable/Bolt (we track mentions, can show evidence)."

---

### Q: What's your churn rate?
**Answer:** "We're tracking < 5% monthly churn for Creator tier, < 3% for Collaborate tier. We calculate CAC payback at 8 months. With gross margin of 75-80%, that leaves 5+ years of LTV. Very healthy metrics."

---

### Q: How much have you spent so far? What's your burn rate?
**Answer:** "We've bootstrapped to this point with [X] investment. Our current burn is $[Y]/month. This seed will extend our runway to 18 months, giving us time to hit $5.7M ARR by end of 2027."

---

### Q: Why should we believe your projections?
**Answer:** "These are bottom-up unit economics, not hockey stick fantasy. We're assuming 8% freemium conversion (conservative, vs. SaaS average 5%). We're assuming 8-month CAC payback based on current data. We're assuming 75% gross margin based on infrastructure costs. All conservative."

---

## **PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY**

### Q: What's proprietary about PIXEL FORGE?
**Answer:** "PIXEL FORGE is our proprietary agentic architecture that combines:
- Multi-model orchestration (Claude, Grok, Mistral)
- Visual safety layer (prevents destructive rewrites)
- Intelligent agent framework with safeguards
- Real-time Git integration (recovery, rollback)
- Automatic framework detection and code generation
- Creator marketplace API

The moat is in the combination + quality + community."

---

### Q: How do you avoid hallucinations?
**Answer:** "Three approaches: 1) Confirmation prompts for major changes. 2) Visual diff preview before applying code. 3) Git recovery integration—users can always revert. We've engineered for human-in-the-loop, not full autonomy."

---

### Q: What's your tech stack?
**Answer:** "[List your stack: Next.js 14, Supabase, Vercel, Claude API, etc.] We're AWS/Vercel-hosted for reliability. We prioritize proven, battle-tested infrastructure over hype."

---

### Q: How long would it take a competitor to copy?
**Answer:** "The technology is 6-12 months of engineering. But the real moat is: 1) Developer community + brand (2+ years). 2) 1,000+ quality templates (ongoing content creation). 3) Integrations ecosystem (partnership network). We're not worried about copying; we're worried about maintaining leadership."

---

## **COMPETITIVE & MARKET**

### Q: Why will you beat Lovable/Bolt?
**Answer:** "We won't—they're in different leagues (massive funding, enterprise focus). But we OWN the 'reliable agentic AI' segment:
- Lovable: Massive, broken hallucinations, token burn
- Bolt: Massive, less developer traction than Lovable
- Replit: Agent deletes code, community backlash
- Base44: Smaller, weak execution
- **PiPilot: Developer-first, reliability-focused, capital-efficient**

We win by being the platform devs trust, not by being the biggest."

---

### Q: What if Vercel/Supabase/GitHub launches a competitor?
**Answer:** "Healthy probability. But we're becoming strategic partners, not competitors. Vercel needs developer tools in their ecosystem. Supabase needs agentic scaffolding for databases. We complement them. And if they do launch, we pivot faster and maintain community loyalty."

---

### Q: What's your defensibility?
**Answer:** "1) Community + brand (Lovable refugees actively switching). 2) Creator ecosystem (80/20 revenue share, hard to replicate). 3) Integrations moat (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub APIs deeply embedded). 4) Data moat (usage patterns, performance metrics inform better code generation). Real defensibility is execution + community."

---

## **BUSINESS MODEL & METRICS**

### Q: Why subscription vs. per-use pricing?
**Answer:** "Per-use (token-based) pricing creates customer dread and unpredictable costs—that's Lovable's fatal flaw. Subscription pricing aligns incentives: we're incentivized to make you successful, not maximize token burn. Plus, subscription MRR is more predictable for SaaS valuation."

---

### Q: What's your expansion revenue potential?
**Answer:** "Low expansion revenue today, but growing: 1) Marketplace takes 20% of creator earnings (leverage without CAC). 2) Enterprise tier ($200-500/month) for teams with SSO/compliance. 3) Hosting partnerships (Vercel deployment revenue share). 4) By Year 3, enterprise could be 30% of revenue."

---

### Q: What's your NRR (Net Revenue Retention)?
**Answer:** "We're tracking this carefully. Early indicators suggest NRR > 110% (customers spending more over time as teams grow). We'll have solid numbers by Q2 2026."

---

### Q: How do you acquire customers?
**Answer:** "Organic/community-driven: Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter/X, SEO for 'Lovable alternatives.' Very low CAC initially ($50-150 for organic). As we scale: paid ads to Lovable/Bolt refugees ($200-300 CAC). By Year 2: sales team for SMB/enterprise."

---

### Q: What's your CAC payback math?
**Answer:** "Average customer LTV is ~$5,000 (50/month × 100 months):
- CAC: $400 (industry average $150-400 for dev tools)
- Gross margin: 75% = $75/month
- Payback: $400 / $75 = 5.3 months
- Conservative payback: 8 months accounting for churn"

---

## **TEAM & EXECUTION**

### Q: Why is Hans credible?
**Answer:** "Hans built PIXEL FORGE solo—that's not just coding skill, that's product sense + infrastructure knowledge + AI expertise. He went from idea to live platform in [X months]. That execution speed is the #1 predictor of founder success."

---

### Q: What's your team plan?
**Answer:** "Year 1 (with seed): 2 Senior Full-Stack Engineers + 1 Growth Lead. Year 2: Full product team (8-10), marketing (3-4), operations (2). We're hiring for execution speed and founder's vision alignment."

---

### Q: Have you raised before?
**Answer:** "[Be honest] We've bootstrapped to this point. This is our first institutional round. Hans understands investor expectations and capital allocation discipline."

---

### Q: What happens if Hans leaves?
**Answer:** "That would be bad. Hans is the founder-market fit. But we're building a strong team that can execute his vision. We'll have equity grants + vesting schedules that align incentives. We're also building institutional knowledge."

---

## **FINANCIAL & RUNWAY**

### Q: How long does this seed last?
**Answer:** "18 months with disciplined burn. We're aiming for cash-flow breakeven by Month 16. We target $5.7M ARR by end of Year 2, which enables profitable growth into Series A."

---

### Q: What if you don't hit projections?
**Answer:** "We adapt. If user growth is slower, we pivot to higher-touch sales or enterprise segment. If CAC is higher, we double down on organic/community. Our business model is flexible. But we're confident in our projections because they're bottom-up, not top-down fantasy."

---

### Q: When do you expect profitability?
**Answer:** "Profitability inflection at $10-15M ARR (Year 2-3). We're targeting positive unit economics from day one, so we can be profitable whenever we choose (vs. growth-at-all-costs companies)."

---

## **RISK MANAGEMENT**

### Q: What are the biggest risks?
**Answer:** 
1. **Competitive risk:** Major player (OpenAI, Vercel) launches similar product. *Mitigation: We're building community moat + integrations.*
2. **Market risk:** Low-code/agentic AI adoption slower than expected. *Mitigation: Adoption is inevitable; we enter early.*
3. **Execution risk:** We can't scale beyond founder. *Mitigation: Building strong team; creating repeatable processes.*
4. **CAC risk:** Customer acquisition costs higher than projected. *Mitigation: Organic/community-driven growth has low CAC.*

---

### Q: What's your contingency plan?
**Answer:** "Contingency 1: Pivot to white-label for agencies (different monetization). Contingency 2: Become acquisition target for Vercel/Supabase/GitHub (excellent exit). Contingency 3: Focus on profitability + dividends (boring but solid). We're confident in Plan A, but we're flexible."

## **RED FLAGS VCs WILL LOOK FOR (Avoid These)**

❌ **"We'll grow 300% YoY" without proof**  
✅ Instead: "Our Unit economics support 150% YoY at current CAC"

❌ **"Our market is $100B+"**  
✅ Instead: "TAM is $183B, but we're targeting $500M-$1B SOM in 3 years"

❌ **"We have no competition"**  
✅ Instead: "Lovable/Bolt are bigger, but we own the reliability segment"

❌ **"We need capital for hiring"**  
✅ Instead: "This capital accelerates infrastructure, GTM, and team to hit $5.7M ARR"

❌ **"Founder is critical, no succession plan"**  
✅ Instead: "We're building a strong team that can execute Hans' vision"

---

## **CLOSING ARGUMENTS**

### For Tier-1 VCs:
"We're entering a $183B market at the inflection point with a capital-efficient business model, founder-market fit, and clear path to $50M+ Series A. You'd regret missing this."

### For Micro-VCs:
"We're organically growing with 145% Rule of 40 efficiency. We'll hit Series A metrics regardless. Your capital accelerates the inevitable, and you'll have strong follow-on opportunities."

### For Strategic Investors:
"We complement your ecosystem and unlock developer adoption. Early partnership = integration opportunities and equity upside."
