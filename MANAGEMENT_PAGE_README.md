- **Deployments**: Deployment history, status, and commit information
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of configuration variables

### Data Management Features
- **Export Data**: Download all data as JSON for backup
- **Clear All Data**: Reset the management system
- **Sample Data**: Automatic creation of sample projects for testing

## Security Features

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB
- **No External Dependencies**: Completely offline-capable management system
- **Data Privacy**: Your deployment data never leaves your browser
- **Environment Isolation**: Variables are scoped to specific environments
