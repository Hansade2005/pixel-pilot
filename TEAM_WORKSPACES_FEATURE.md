# 👥 Team Workspaces Feature

**Status:** 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT
**Ship Date:** Target: January 26-27, 2025
**Priority:** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Required for enterprise adoption

## 🎯 Overview

Team Workspaces enable multiple users to collaborate on projects within shared organizations. This is CRITICAL for enterprise adoption and competing with Lovable.dev.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema (✅ COMPLETE)

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20250125_create_team_workspaces.sql`

#### 6 Core Tables:

1. **organizations** - Teams/companies
   - Name, slug, owner
   - Subscription plan (free/team/enterprise)
   - Max members & workspaces limits
   - Stripe billing integration

2. **team_members** - Organization membership
   - Role-based access (owner/admin/editor/viewer)
   - Custom permissions per user
   - Status tracking (active/inactive/pending)

3. **team_workspaces** - Shared projects
   - Visibility levels (private/team/public)
   - File storage as JSONB
   - Activity tracking (last edited by/at)

4. **workspace_members** - Private workspace access
   - Explicit access control for private workspaces
   - Access levels (owner/editor/viewer)

5. **team_invitations** - Invite system
   - Email-based invitations
   - Secure tokens with expiration
   - Status tracking (pending/accepted/declined)

6. **team_activity** - Audit log
   - All team actions logged
   - Workspace-level and org-level events
   - Metadata for context

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner (1 per org)
  └─ Full control over everything
     └─ Can delete organization
     └─ Transfer ownership

Admin (multiple)
  └─ Manage members & billing
     └─ Create/delete workspaces
     └─ Invite users
     └─ ❌ Cannot delete org

Editor (multiple)
  └─ Create/edit workspaces
     └─ Collaborate on projects
     └─ ❌ Cannot manage members

Viewer (multiple)
  └─ View-only access
     └─ See workspaces & code
     └─ ❌ Cannot edit
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

✅ **Fully Implemented:**
- Users can only see their organizations
- Members can only access workspaces they're authorized for
- Role-based permissions enforced at database level
- Admin email hardcoded for super-admin access

### Helper Functions

1. **`is_org_admin(org_id, user_id)`**
   - Check if user has admin privileges
   - Used in API middleware

2. **`log_team_activity(org_id, workspace_id, action, metadata)`**
   - Automatic activity logging
   - Used in triggers and API calls

## 📊 Data Flow

## 📚 Developer Guide

### Running the Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy migration SQL and run in SQL Editor

# Option 3: Via API
# POST to Supabase Management API
```

### Using the API

```typescript
// Create organization
const org = await fetch('/api/teams/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Acme Corp',
    slug: 'acme-corp'
  })
})

// Invite member
await fetch(`/api/teams/${orgId}/invite`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    role: 'editor'
  })
})

// Create team workspace
const workspace = await fetch(`/api/teams/${orgId}/workspaces/create`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Marketing Site',
    template: 'nextjs',
    visibility: 'team'
  })
})
```

### Permission Checks

```typescript
// Check if user is admin
import { is_org_admin } from '@/lib/supabase/teams'

const isAdmin = await is_org_admin(orgId, userId)

// Check workspace access
const hasAccess = await checkWorkspaceAccess(workspaceId, userId)
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Collaboration Yet**
   - File editing is sequential, not concurrent
   - Will be added in Phase 5 with WebSockets

2. **Email Sending**
   - Invitation emails require email service setup
   - Currently returns invitation link to admin

3. **Billing Integration**
   - Stripe integration needs configuration
   - Manual upgrade for now

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 6 (Month 2)
- [ ] Real-time cursors & editing
- [ ] Commenting on code
- [ ] @mentions in comments
- [ ] File locking during edits

### Phase 7 (Month 3)
- [ ] Team analytics dashboard
- [ ] Usage reports
- [ ] Cost allocation by team
- [ ] SSO (SAML/OAuth)

## 📞 Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE:**
1. Run the migration on Supabase
2. Test RLS policies manually
3. Build API routes for organizations
4. Create team dashboard UI

**THIS WEEK:**
1. Complete all API routes
2. Build member management
3. Create workspace sharing
4. Test invitation flow end-to-end
