# Conversation Summarization Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of VSCode's conversation summarization feature into the PiPilot AI app builder system. The system already has comprehensive persistent storage (IndexedDB + Supabase auto-sync), so this plan focuses on implementing intelligent summarization when context windows are exceeded.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components ✅
- **IndexedDB + Auto Cloud Sync**: Complete persistent storage with real-time Supabase synchronization
- **Conversation Memory**: `ConversationMemory` interface with messages, summaries, key points, and timestamps
- **Conversation Summaries**: `ConversationSummary` interface with structured Codestral-generated summaries
- **Token Tracking**: Messages include `tokensUsed` field for usage monitoring
- **Auto-sync Service**: Real-time cloud synchronization with throttling and error handling
- **Chat API**: Streaming responses with tool calling and conversation context
- **Storage Manager**: Universal storage interface supporting both client and server

### Current Limitations
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Already implemented (IndexedDB + Supabase)
- ❌ **Context Window Monitoring**: No automatic detection of token limits
- ❌ **VSCode-Style Summarization**: Basic summaries exist but not the comprehensive 8-section format
- ❌ **Automatic Triggers**: No summarization when context windows approach limits
- ❌ **UI Integration**: No user controls for manual summarization or status display

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Context Window Monitoring ✅

**Objective**: Implement real-time token counting and context window management

**Current Status**: Partially implemented - messages have `tokensUsed` field

**Tasks**:
1. **Token Counter Utility** (`/lib/token-counter.ts`):
   - Integrate tiktoken for accurate token counting across AI models
   - Cache token counts for performance optimization
   - Support different tokenization schemes per provider

2. **Context Window Tracker**:
   - Monitor total conversation tokens in real-time
   - Set configurable limits per AI model
   - Track token usage patterns and predict limits

3. **Pre-summarization Warnings**:
   - Alert users when approaching 80% of context window
   - Provide token usage statistics
   - Suggest manual summarization options

### Phase 2: Enhanced Summarization Service

**Objective**: Upgrade to VSCode's comprehensive 8-section summarization format

**Tasks**:
1. **VSCode Summarization Service** (`/lib/vscode-summarizer.ts`):
   - Implement the exact prompt template from `summarizer.txt`
   - Add analysis phases: chronological review, intent mapping, technical inventory
   - Generate structured 8-section summaries with quality guidelines

2. **AI Model Integration**:
   - Use Mistral Pixtral for high-quality summarization (as in existing code)
   - Fallback mechanisms for different model capabilities
   - Optimize prompts for conversation analysis

3. **Summary Enhancement**:
   - Extend existing `ConversationSummary` interface to match VSCode format
   - Preserve all technical details and context for continuation
   - Include file operations log, active work state, and pending steps

### Phase 3: Automatic Summarization Triggers

**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate summarization into chat flow

**Tasks**:
1. **Context Window Monitoring** in Chat API:
   - Track conversation token usage in real-time
   - Automatic summarization at 80% context usage
   - Emergency truncation when hard limits reached

2. **Summarization Workflow**:
   - Generate VSCode-style summary using existing Mistral integration
   - Store summary in existing `ConversationSummary` table
   - Inject summary context into ongoing conversation
   - Maintain conversation continuity

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Progressive summarization (summarize older parts first)
   - Emergency truncation when summarization fails
   - User notifications for summarization events

### Phase 4: UI Integration & Controls

**Objective**: Provide user visibility and control over summarization

**Tasks**:
1. **Chat Panel Enhancements** (`/components/workspace/chat-panel.tsx`):
   - Add context window usage indicator
   - Show summarization status and notifications
   - Display token usage statistics

2. **Manual Summarization Controls**:
   - "Summarize Conversation" button in chat interface
   - Summary history viewer with expandable sections
   - Settings for summarization preferences

3. **Summary Visualization**:
   - Visual boundaries between summarized and active conversation
   - Expandable summary sections in chat history
   - Clear indicators for summarized content

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

**Objective**: Validate summarization quality and performance

**Tasks**:
1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for token counting accuracy
   - Integration tests for summarization triggers
   - End-to-end tests with long conversations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Summary caching to avoid regeneration
   - Background summarization for long conversations
   - Optimize token counting for real-time usage

3. **Quality Validation**:
   - Test summarization accuracy across different conversation types
   - Validate context preservation for task continuation
   - User acceptance testing for UI/UX

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database**: Supabase for persistence and real-time capabilities
- **Tokenization**: tiktoken library for accurate counting
- **Summarization Model**: Mistral Pixtral for high-quality analysis
- **Storage**: JSONB for flexible summary metadata storage

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of conversation history
- Summary caching to avoid regeneration
- Background summarization for long conversations
- Progressive summary updates

### Security & Privacy
- RLS policies ensure users only access their conversations
- Summary content sanitization
- Audit logging for summarization operations
- Data retention policies for old conversations

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- ✅ Automatic summarization triggers at 80% context usage
- ✅ Manual summarization available on demand
