### 1. MessageWithTools Component ✅
**File**: `components/workspace/message-with-tools.tsx`

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Renders AI SDK `toolInvocations` from messages
- ✅ Handles `state === 'call'` (tool loading state)
- ✅ Handles `state === 'result'` (tool completed state)
- ✅ Uses existing `<Task />` component for collapsible tool display
- ✅ Uses existing `<Response />` component for markdown rendering
- ✅ Dispatches `json-tool-executed` event (maintains compatibility)
- ✅ Dispatches `files-changed` event for file operations
- ✅ Shows loading indicators for in-progress tools
- ✅ Shows success/error icons for completed tools
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ **No errors found**

**Event Dispatching**:
```typescript
// Maintains compatibility with existing file explorer
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('json-tool-executed', { ... }))
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('files-changed', { ... }))
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Message Flow

1. **User sends message** → ChatPanel V2 `handleEnhancedSubmit()`
2. **Attachments processed** → File contents, images, URLs added to message
3. **AI SDK useChat** → Sends to `/api/chat-v2`
4. **Backend streamText** → Processes with native tools
5. **Tool invocations** → Streamed back to frontend in real-time
6. **MessageWithTools** → Renders tools with state indicators
7. **Event dispatchers** → Fire when tools complete
8. **File Explorer** → Updates automatically via events

### Tool Execution Flow

```
AI decides to use tool
      ↓
Frontend receives toolInvocation (state: 'call')
      ↓
MessageWithTools shows loading indicator
      ↓
Backend executes tool
      ↓
Frontend receives result (state: 'result')
      ↓
MessageWithTools shows success/error
      ↓
Events dispatched to update UI
```

### Multi-Step Tooling Example

```
User: "Create a new Button component and add it to the homepage"

Step 1: write_file → Create Button.tsx
Step 2: write_file → Update homepage with Button import
Step 3: write_file → Update homepage JSX with <Button />

All steps stream in real-time!
```

## 🎯 What's Different from Original

### Original Chat Panel
- ❌ Custom `useState` for messages
- ❌ Manual streaming with buffering
- ❌ Custom tool detection from JSON blocks
- ❌ Delayed tool visibility (after full response)
- ❌ Complex streaming state management
- ❌ 8396 lines of code

### New ChatPanel V2
- ✅ AI SDK `useChat` hook
- ✅ Instant streaming with `toDataStreamResponse()`
- ✅ Native tool definitions with `tool()`
- ✅ Real-time tool invocation display
- ✅ Automatic state management
- ✅ ~700 lines of code (simpler!)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Testing Phase

1. **Test New Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Start your development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create Toggle Integration** (Optional):
   - Add a switch in workspace UI to toggle between v1 and v2
   - Let users test both side-by-side
   - Gather feedback on which feels better

3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - ✅ Simple file creation
   - ✅ Multiple file operations in one request
   - ✅ Package add/remove
   - ✅ File attachments
   - ✅ Image uploads
   - ✅ Speech-to-text
   - ✅ Multi-step tooling (ask for complex task)
   - ✅ Event dispatchers (check file explorer updates)

### Integration Options

**Option A: Side-by-Side Testing** (Safest)
- Keep both chat-panel.tsx and chat-panel-v2.tsx
- Add toggle button to switch between them
- Test thoroughly before full migration

**Option B: Direct Swap**
- Update workspace page to import ChatPanelV2 instead of ChatPanel
- Rename old file to chat-panel-legacy.tsx as backup
- Monitor for issues

**Option C: Gradual Migration**
- Use V2 for new projects only
- Keep V1 for existing projects
- Migrate after confidence builds
