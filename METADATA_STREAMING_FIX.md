# Metadata Streaming Fix - Large Payload Chunking Issue

## Problem
Backend was successfully sending metadata to frontend, but frontend never received it. Logs showed:
- ‚úÖ Backend: "Metadata sent successfully to frontend" 
- ‚ùå Frontend: No "üì• Received metadata" logs
- ‚ùå Frontend: No file operations applied
- ‚ùå Frontend: No toast notifications

## Root Cause
**Large metadata payloads (~113KB) were being split across multiple TCP chunks**, causing incomplete JSON to be parsed.

### Technical Details
1. Backend sends metadata as single newline-delimited JSON: `{...large object...}\n`
2. TCP layer splits large messages into multiple chunks (e.g., 64KB chunks)
3. Frontend's `reader.read()` returns partial data:
   - Chunk 1: `{"type":"metadata","fileOper...` (incomplete JSON)
   - Chunk 2: `...ations":[...],"toolInvoca...` (middle of JSON)
   - Chunk 3: `...tions":[]}\n` (end of JSON)
4. Old code parsed each chunk immediately: `JSON.parse(line)` ‚Üí **SyntaxError**
5. Error was silently caught and logged as "Skipping malformed chunk"

## Solution
Implemented **line buffering** to handle partial messages:

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })
const lines = chunk.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim())

for (const line of lines) {
  const parsed = JSON.parse(line) // ‚ùå Fails on partial JSON
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
let lineBuffer = '' // Persistent buffer across reads

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read()
  if (done) {
    // Process any remaining buffered line
    if (lineBuffer.trim()) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(lineBuffer) // ‚úÖ Complete JSON
    }
    break
  }

  const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })
  lineBuffer += chunk
  const lines = lineBuffer.split('\n')
  lineBuffer = lines.pop() || '' // Keep incomplete line
  
  for (const line of lines.filter(l => l.trim())) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(line) // ‚úÖ Only complete JSON lines
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Stream Parsing (`components/workspace/chat-panel-v2.tsx`)

#### Added Line Buffer
```typescript
let lineBuffer = '' // Buffer for incomplete lines across chunks
```

#### Fixed Chunk Processing
- Accumulate chunks into buffer
- Split by newlines
- Keep last incomplete line in buffer
- Only parse complete lines
- Process final buffer when stream ends

#### Enhanced Error Logging
```typescript
catch (e) {
  console.error('[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] ‚ùå Failed to parse chunk:', {
    error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e),
    line: line.substring(0, 200), // Show problematic data
    lineLength: line.length
  })
}
```

### 2. Metadata Reception Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track metadata processing:
- Full metadata object logged for debugging
- Detailed warnings when arrays are missing
- Success confirmations at each step

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Backend Logs (Unchanged)
```
[DEBUG] üì§ Sending metadata to frontend: {
  fileOperationsCount: 13,
  toolInvocationsCount: 16,
  metadataSize: 115830
}
[DEBUG] ‚úÖ Metadata sent successfully to frontend
```

### Frontend Logs (New)
```
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] üì• Received metadata from backend: {
  hasToolInvocations: true,
  toolInvocationsCount: 16,
  hasFileOperations: true,
  fileOperationsCount: 13,
  fileOperationTypes: [...],
  rawMetadata: {...}
}
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] ‚úÖ Stored tool invocations: 16
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] ‚úÖ Stored file operations for application: 13
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] üéâ Metadata processing complete
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] üìä Stream complete. Final state: {
  contentLength: 1234,
  toolInvocationsCount: 16,
  fileOperationsCount: 13
}
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] üîÑ Applying all file operations from server...
[ChatPanelV2][DataStream] ‚úÖ Processed 13 operations: 10 write operations applied, 3 read-only operations skipped
```

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ Toast notification: "Successfully applied 10 file operation(s)"
- ‚úÖ File explorer auto-refreshes
- ‚úÖ Tool pills display all operations (read + write)
- ‚úÖ Files persist in IndexedDB

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Small metadata (<1KB) - should work as before
- [ ] Large metadata (>100KB) - now works with buffering
- [ ] Multiple file operations in one request
- [ ] Mixed read/write operations
- [ ] Empty metadata (no operations)
- [ ] Network interruptions
- [ ] Console shows complete metadata logs

## Technical Debt
- Consider chunking metadata on backend side (send operations in batches)
- Add compression for large metadata payloads
- Implement max metadata size limits with overflow handling
- Add retry logic for corrupted metadata

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead**: Buffer operations are O(n) where n = chunk size
- **Memory**: ~200KB peak (lineBuffer + parsed objects)
- **Latency**: No additional latency (same network roundtrips)
