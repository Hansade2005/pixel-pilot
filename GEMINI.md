Agentic AI Workflow

Agentic AI systems follow a structured loop to ensure reliability, adaptability, and continuous improvement. The workflow is broken down into four key phases:

1. Explore

Understand the Context: Gather relevant information (files, data, prior outputs, user instructions, system state).

Identify Requirements: Clarify objectives, constraints, and success criteria.

Assess Options: Consider multiple approaches, tools, and APIs that could solve the task.

2. Plan

Define Strategy: Select the most effective approach based on constraints, goals, and available resources.

Break Down Tasks: Decompose complex goals into smaller, executable steps.

Anticipate Risks: Identify potential failure points and outline fallback strategies.

3. Execute

Take Action: Perform the defined steps (generate content, run code, call APIs, update components, etc.).

Maintain Modularity: Apply changes incrementally to avoid breaking existing functionality.

Log Actions: Document key operations and decisions for traceability.

4. Verify

Check Results: Validate outputs against success criteria (correctness, usability, consistency).

Test Scenarios: Run through edge cases and ensure stability across contexts.

Iterate if Needed: If verification fails, return to Explore or Plan before re-executing.

Continuous Loop

This cycle is iterative: once verification is complete, the system can re-explore new requirements or re-plan adjustments, maintaining adaptability and long-term reliability.

⚡ By structuring agentic AI work into Explore → Plan → Execute → Verify, the system ensures actions are informed, deliberate, validated, and adaptable.
