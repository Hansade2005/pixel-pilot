Master these techniques to get consistently excellent results from AI systems.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n#### 1. Clarity and Specificity\n**Bad Prompt:** \"Write code for a button\"\n\n**Good Prompt:** \"Create a React component for a primary action button that:\n- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Has hover and focus states\n- Supports loading states\n- Includes proper accessibility attributes\n- Follows the design system guidelines\n\nComponent should be reusable and well-documented.\"\n\n#### 2. Context Provision\nAlways provide relevant context:\n- **Technical Context**: Framework, language, architecture\n- **Business Context**: Use case, requirements, constraints\n- **User Context**: Target audience, experience level\n- **Project Context**: Existing codebase, patterns, conventions\n\n#### 3. Task Decomposition\nBreak complex tasks into manageable steps:\n- Design the product data structure\n- Create the main product component\n- Implement image gallery\n- Add product variants selector\n- Create reviews section\n- Add to cart functionality\n- Implement related products\n\n### Advanced Techniques\n\n#### Chain of Thought Prompting\nGuide the AI through step-by-step reasoning:\n\"Solve this step by step:\n1. Analyze the problem\n2. Break down requirements\n3. Design the solution\n4. Implement the code\n5. Test and validate\n\nProblem: Create a user authentication system...\"\n\n#### Few-Shot Learning\nProvide examples within the prompt:\n\"Generate React components like these examples:\n\nExample 1 - Button:\nconst Button = ({ children, variant }) => <button className={'btn btn-' + variant}>{children}</button>\n\nExample 2 - Input:\nconst Input = ({ type, placeholder }) => <input type={type} placeholder={placeholder} />\n\nNow create a Card component:\"\n\n### Industry-Specific Prompting\n\n#### Web Development\n\"As a senior React developer, create a modern, accessible, and performant component that handles [specific requirement]. Use:\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- React hooks for state management\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Proper error handling\n- Loading states\n- Accessibility features\"\n\n#### Data Science\n\"As a data scientist, analyze this dataset and:\n1. Perform exploratory data analysis\n2. Identify key patterns and insights\n3. Build a predictive model\n4. Evaluate model performance\n5. Provide recommendations\n\nDataset: [dataset description]\"",
                "notes": "### Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Structure and Format\n- **Clear Instructions**: Be explicit about requirements\n- **Logical Flow**: Organize information systematically\n- **Actionable Tasks**: Specify concrete deliverables\n- **Success Criteria**: Define what good output looks like\n\n#### 2. Context Management\n- **Relevant Information**: Include only necessary context\n- **Current State**: Reference existing codebase/project\n- **Constraints**: Specify limitations and requirements\n- **Goals**: Clearly state objectives and priorities\n\n#### 3. Error Prevention\n- **Edge Cases**: Anticipate potential issues\n- **Validation**: Include validation requirements\n- **Fallbacks**: Provide backup approaches\n- **Recovery**: Specify error handling procedures\n\n#### 4. Continuous Improvement\n- **Feedback Loop**: Collect and analyze results\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful patterns\n- **Template Creation**: Build reusable prompt templates\n- **Team Sharing**: Distribute effective prompts with team",

                "content": "## JSX & Component Architecture\n\nJSX represents a paradigm shift in how we think about building user interfaces. This comprehensive lesson explores the deep connection between JSX and React's component architecture.\n\n### JSX Fundamentals\n\n#### What is JSX?\nJSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It's not magic - it's compiled to regular JavaScript function calls.\n\n#### Compilation Process\n```javascript\n// What you write:\nconst element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n\n// What JSX compiles to:\nconst element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');\n```\n\n### Component Design Patterns\n\n#### 1. Functional Components\n```javascript\nfunction Welcome(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Class Components (Legacy)\n```javascript\nclass Welcome extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Higher-Order Components (HOC)\n```javascript\nfunction withAuth(WrappedComponent) {\n  return class extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      if (this.props.isAuthenticated) {\n        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;\n      }\n      return <LoginPrompt />;\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Advanced JSX Features\n\n#### Conditional Rendering\n```javascript\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;\n  }\n  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;\n}\n\n// Or using ternary operator:\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign up.</h1>}\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n#### Lists and Keys\n```javascript\nfunction NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>\n    <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>\n  );\n  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;\n}\n```\n\n#### Event Handling\n```javascript\nfunction ActionButton() {\n  function handleClick(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    console.log('The button was clicked.');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Component Composition Patterns\n\n#### Container vs Presentational Components\n```javascript\n// Presentational Component (dumb)\nfunction UserProfile(props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.name}</h1>\n      <p>{props.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Container Component (smart)\nfunction UserProfileContainer() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchUser().then(setUser);\n  }, []);\n  \n  return <UserProfile {...user} />;\n}\n```\n\n#### Render Props Pattern\n```javascript\nfunction MouseTracker({ render }) {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\n  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {\n    setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>\n      {render(position)}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage:\n<MouseTracker render={({ x, y }) => (\n  <h1>The mouse position is ({x}, {y})</h1>\n)} />\n```",
                "notes": "### Best Practices for JSX & Components\n\n#### 1. Component Naming\n- Use PascalCase for component names\n- File names should match component names\n- Use descriptive, specific names\n\n#### 2. Props Handling\n- Always validate props with PropTypes or TypeScript\n- Provide sensible defaults for optional props\n- Avoid mutating props directly\n- Use destructuring for cleaner code\n\n#### 3. JSX Best Practices\n- Always wrap multiline JSX in parentheses\n- Use self-closing tags for elements without children\n- Keep JSX readable with proper indentation\n- Extract complex JSX into separate components\n\n#### 4. Performance Considerations\n- Use React.memo for expensive components\n- Implement shouldComponentUpdate when necessary\n- Avoid inline functions in render\n- Use keys properly for list rendering\n\n### Common JSX Patterns\n\n#### 1. Conditional Classes\n```javascript\nfunction Button({ variant, disabled }) {\n  const className = [\n    'btn',\n    variant && `btn-${variant}`,\n    disabled && 'btn-disabled'\n  ].filter(Boolean).join(' ');\n  \n  return <button className={className} disabled={disabled} />;\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Attributes\n```javascript\nfunction Input({ type = 'text', ...props }) {\n  const inputProps = {\n    type,\n    ...props,\n    className: `input input-${type}`\n  };\n  \n  return <input {...inputProps} />;\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Children as Functions\n```javascript\nfunction DataProvider({ children, data }) {\n  return children(data);\n}\n\n// Usage:\n<DataProvider data={userData}>\n  {(data) => <UserProfile user={data} />}\n</DataProvider>\n```",

This comprehensive lesson covers advanced patterns for managing state effectively.\n\n### Local State vs Global State\n\n#### When to Use Local State\n- Component-specific data\n- Temporary UI state\n- Form input values\n- Component lifecycle data\n\n#### When to Use Global State\n- User authentication status\n- Application settings\n- Cached API data\n- Multi-component shared state\n\n### Advanced useState Patterns\n\n#### 1. State as an Object\n```javascript\nfunction UserProfile() {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState({\n    name: '',\n    email: '',\n    preferences: {}\n  });\n\n  const updateUser = (updates) => {\n    setUser(prevUser => ({\n      ...prevUser,\n      ...updates\n    }));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        value={user.name}\n        onChange={(e) => updateUser({ name: e.target.value })}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. State with Complex Logic\n```javascript\nfunction useCustomState(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const increment = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(prev => prev + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  const decrement = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(prev => prev - 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return { value, increment, decrement, reset };\n}\n```\n\n### useReducer for Complex State\n\n#### Basic useReducer\n```javascript\nfunction counterReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    case 'RESET':\n      return { count: 0 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'RESET' })}>Reset</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Complex State with useReducer\n```javascript\nconst todoReducer = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: [...state.todos, {\n          id: Date.now(),\n          text: action.payload,\n          completed: false\n        }]\n      };\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: state.todos.map(todo =>\n          todo.id === action.payload\n            ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }\n            : todo\n        )\n      };\n    case 'DELETE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload)\n      };\n    case 'FILTER_TODOS':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        filter: action.payload\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Context API for Global State\n\n#### Creating Context\n```javascript\nconst ThemeContext = createContext({\n  theme: 'light',\n  toggleTheme: () => {}\n});\n\nexport function ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n  const toggleTheme = useCallback(() => {\n    setTheme(prevTheme => prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');\n  }, []);\n\n  const value = {\n    theme,\n    toggleTheme\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>\n      {children}\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Using Context\n```javascript\nfunction ThemedButton() {\n  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={`btn btn-${theme}`}\n      onClick={toggleTheme}\n    >\n      Toggle Theme\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hooks for State Management\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useApi(endpoint) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let isMounted = true;\n\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        setLoading(true);\n        const response = await fetch(endpoint);\n        const result = await response.json();\n        \n        if (isMounted) {\n          setData(result);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      } catch (err) {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setError(err.message);\n          setData(null);\n        }\n      } finally {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n\n    return () => {\n      isMounted = false;\n    };\n  }, [endpoint]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error, refetch: () => fetchData() };\n}\n```\n\n#### Form State Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useForm(initialValues, validate) {\n  const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);\n  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});\n  const [touched, setTouched] = useState({});\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((name, value) => {\n    setValues(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));\n    \n    if (touched[name]) {\n      const validationErrors = validate({ ...values, [name]: value });\n      setErrors(validationErrors);\n    }\n  }, [values, touched, validate]);\n\n  const handleBlur = useCallback((name) => {\n    setTouched(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: true }));\n    const validationErrors = validate(values);\n    setErrors(validationErrors);\n  }, [values, validate]);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValues(initialValues);\n    setErrors({});\n    setTouched({});\n  }, [initialValues]);\n\n  return {\n    values,\n    errors,\n    touched,\n    handleChange,\n    handleBlur,\n    reset,\n    isValid: Object.keys(errors).length === 0\n  };\n}\n```",
                "notes": "### State Management Best Practices\n\n#### 1. State Colocation\n- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used\n- Lift state up only when necessary\n- Use local state for component-specific data\n\n#### 2. State Updates\n- Always use functional updates for state based on previous state\n- Avoid direct state mutations\n- Batch state updates when possible\n- Use useCallback for event handlers\n\n#### 3. Performance Optimization\n- Use useMemo for expensive computations\n- Use useCallback for functions passed as props\n- Implement proper dependency arrays\n- Avoid unnecessary re-renders\n\n#### 4. State Persistence\n- Use localStorage for client-side persistence\n- Consider server state with libraries like React Query\n- Implement proper loading and error states\n- Handle offline scenarios gracefully\n\n### Common State Management Patterns\n\n#### 1. Lifting State Up\n```javascript\nfunction ParentComponent() {\n  const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ChildA state={sharedState} onStateChange={setSharedState} />\n      <ChildB state={sharedState} onStateChange={setSharedState} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. State Reducer Pattern\n```javascript\nconst complexStateReducer = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'UPDATE_FIELD':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        [action.field]: action.value\n      };\n    case 'ADD_ITEM':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        items: [...state.items, action.item]\n      };\n    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        items: state.items.filter(item => item.id !== action.id)\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Compound Components\n```javascript\nfunction Tabs({ children }) {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);\n\n  return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n    React.cloneElement(child, {\n      isActive: index === activeTab,\n      onClick: () => setActiveTab(index)\n    })\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Tab({ isActive, onClick, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}\n      onClick={onClick}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage:\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab>Tab 1</Tab>\n  <Tab>Tab 2</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n```",

This comprehensive lesson covers everything from basic syntax to advanced variable management techniques.\n\n### Python Syntax Fundamentals\n\n#### Variable Declaration & Assignment\n```python\n# Basic variable assignment\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\nheight = 5.8\nis_student = True\n\n# Multiple assignment\nx, y, z = 1, 2, 3\n\n# Chained assignment\na = b = c = 0\n\n# Swapping variables\na, b = b, a\n```\n\n#### Dynamic Typing & Type Inference\n```python\n# Python infers types automatically\nvariable = 42          # int\nvariable = 42.0        # float\nvariable = \"42\"        # str\nvariable = True        # bool\n\n# Type checking\nprint(type(variable))   # <class 'int'>\nprint(isinstance(variable, int))  # True\n```\n\n### Built-in Data Types\n\n#### Numeric Types\n```python\n# Integers\ninteger_num = 42\nlarge_num = 1_000_000  # Underscore for readability\nbinary = 0b1010       # Binary\noctal = 0o52          # Octal\nhexadecimal = 0x2A    # Hexadecimal\n\n# Floating Point\nfloat_num = 3.14159\nscientific = 1.23e-4  # Scientific notation\ncomplex_num = 3 + 4j # Complex numbers\n\n# Type conversions\nint_to_float = float(42)\nfloat_to_int = int(3.7)  # Truncates, not rounds\nstring_to_int = int(\"123\")\n```\n\n#### String Operations\n```python\n# String creation\nsingle_quotes = 'Hello World'\ndouble_quotes = \"Hello World\"\ntriple_quotes = \"\"\"Multi-line\nstring\"\"\"\n\n# String methods\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(text.upper())        # 'HELLO, WORLD!'\nprint(text.lower())        # 'hello, world!'\nprint(text.title())        # 'Hello, World!'\nprint(text.split(','))     # ['Hello', ' World!']\nprint(text.replace('World', 'Python'))  # 'Hello, Python!'\n\n# String formatting\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\n\n# f-strings (Python 3.6+)\nprint(f\"{name} is {age} years old\")\n\n# format() method\nprint(\"{} is {} years old\".format(name, age))\n\n# % formatting\nprint(\"%s is %d years old\" % (name, age))\n```",
                "notes": "### Python Variable Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Naming Conventions\n- Use descriptive, meaningful names\n- Follow PEP 8 style guide\n- Use snake_case for variables and functions\n- Use UPPER_CASE for constants\n- Avoid single-letter names (except in loops)\n\n#### 2. Type Safety\n- Use type hints for better code documentation\n- Leverage static type checkers like mypy\n- Consider gradual typing adoption\n- Document complex type relationships\n\n#### 3. Memory Efficiency\n- Be aware of object references vs copies\n- Use appropriate data structures for your use case\n- Consider memory usage in large datasets\n- Implement proper cleanup for resources\n\n#### 4. Scope Management\n- Minimize global variables\n- Use local scope when possible\n- Understand closure behavior\n- Avoid variable shadowing\n\n### Common Python Idioms\n\n#### 1. Truth Value Testing\n```python\n# Instead of:\nif len(my_list) > 0:\n    # do something\n\n# Use:\nif my_list:\n    # do something\n\n# But be careful with falsy values:\nif my_list is not None:  # More explicit\n    # do something\n```\n\n#### 2. Multiple Assignment\n```python\n# Unpacking\nx, y, z = coordinates\n\n# Extended unpacking\na, *rest, b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(rest)  # [2, 3, 4]\n\n# Swapping\nx, y = y, x\n```",

                "content": "## Database Systems Architecture\n\nDatabase systems form the backbone of modern applications. Understanding different database architectures and their appropriate use cases is crucial for designing efficient, scalable systems.\n\n### Database Architecture Types\n\n#### Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n```sql\n-- Relational Database Schema Example\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    order_date DATE NOT NULL,\n    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,\n    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'\n);\n```\n\n#### NoSQL Database Systems\n```javascript\n// MongoDB Document Structure\ndb.users.insertOne({\n  _id: ObjectId(),\n  username: \"johndoe\",\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  profile: {\n    firstName: \"John\",\n    lastName: \"Doe\",\n    age: 30,\n    interests: [\"technology\", \"sports\", \"music\"]\n  },\n  orders: [\n    {\n      orderId: \"ORD-001\",\n      date: new Date(),\n      items: [\n        { productId: \"PROD-001\", quantity: 2, price: 29.99 }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  createdAt: new Date(),\n  lastLogin: new Date()\n});\n```\n\n### Database Design Principles\n\n#### Entity-Relationship Modeling\n```sql\n-- ERD Implementation in SQL\n-- Entities become tables, relationships become foreign keys\n\n-- One-to-One Relationship\nCREATE TABLE user_profiles (\n    profile_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    bio TEXT,\n    avatar_url VARCHAR(500),\n    social_links JSONB\n);\n\n-- One-to-Many Relationship\nCREATE TABLE posts (\n    post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),\n    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n    content TEXT,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Many-to-Many Relationship\nCREATE TABLE post_tags (\n    post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id),\n    tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(tag_id),\n    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)\n);\n```\n\n#### Normalization Theory\n```sql\n-- UNF (Unnormalized Form)\nCREATE TABLE orders_denormalized (\n    order_id INTEGER,\n    customer_name VARCHAR(100),\n    customer_address VARCHAR(200),\n    product_name VARCHAR(100),\n    product_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    quantity INTEGER,\n    order_date DATE\n);\n\n-- 1NF (First Normal Form) - Eliminate repeating groups\nCREATE TABLE orders_1nf (\n    order_id INTEGER,\n    customer_name VARCHAR(100),\n    customer_address VARCHAR(200),\n    order_date DATE,\n    product_name VARCHAR(100),\n    product_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    quantity INTEGER\n);\n\n-- 2NF (Second Normal Form) - Remove partial dependencies\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_name VARCHAR(100),\n    customer_address VARCHAR(200)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    product_name VARCHAR(100),\n    product_price DECIMAL(10,2)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders_2nf (\n    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),\n    order_date DATE\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders_2nf(order_id),\n    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(product_id),\n    quantity INTEGER,\n    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)\n);\n\n-- 3NF (Third Normal Form) - Remove transitive dependencies\n-- (Already in 3NF in this example)\n```\n\n### Database Indexing Strategies\n\n#### B-Tree Indexes\n```sql\n-- Single Column Index\nCREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);\n\n-- Composite Index\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);\n\n-- Partial Index\nCREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(user_id) WHERE active = true;\n\n-- Unique Index\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_username ON users(LOWER(username));\n```\n\n#### Index Usage Analysis\n```sql\n-- Analyze index usage\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE\nSELECT * FROM users\nWHERE email = 'john@example.com';\n\n-- Index maintenance\nREINDEX INDEX idx_users_email;\n\n-- Index statistics\nSELECT\n    schemaname,\n    tablename,\n    indexname,\n    idx_scan,\n    idx_tup_read,\n    idx_tup_fetch\nFROM pg_stat_user_indexes\nORDER BY idx_scan DESC;\n```\n\n### Database Performance Optimization\n\n#### Query Optimization\n```sql\n-- Inefficient query\nSELECT * FROM orders o\nJOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\nWHERE o.order_date >= '2023-01-01';\n\n-- Optimized with proper indexing\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);\n\n-- Efficient query\nSELECT\n    o.order_id,\n    c.customer_name,\n    o.order_date,\n    o.total_amount\nFROM orders o\nJOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\nWHERE o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'\nORDER BY o.order_date DESC;\n```\n\n#### Connection Pooling\n```javascript\n// Node.js Connection Pooling\nconst mysql = require('mysql2');\nconst pool = mysql.createPool({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'dbuser',\n  password: 'dbpass',\n  database: 'myapp',\n  waitForConnections: true,\n  connectionLimit: 10,\n  queueLimit: 0\n});\n\n// Usage\npool.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId], (err, results) => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(results);\n});\n```\n\n### Advanced Database Patterns\n\n#### Database Sharding\n```sql\n-- Horizontal partitioning strategy\n-- Shard by user_id ranges\nCREATE TABLE users_shard_1 (CHECK (user_id >= 1 AND user_id < 1000000))\nINHERITS (users);\n\nCREATE TABLE users_shard_2 (CHECK (user_id >= 1000000 AND user_id < 2000000))\nINHERITS (users);\n\n-- Shard routing function\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION users_insert_trigger()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n    IF (NEW.user_id >= 1 AND NEW.user_id < 1000000) THEN\n        INSERT INTO users_shard_1 VALUES (NEW.*);\n    ELSIF (NEW.user_id >= 1000000 AND NEW.user_id < 2000000) THEN\n        INSERT INTO users_shard_2 VALUES (NEW.*);\n    ELSE\n        RAISE EXCEPTION 'User ID out of range';\n    END IF;\n    RETURN NULL;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n#### Read Replicas & High Availability\n```sql\n-- PostgreSQL streaming replication setup\n-- Primary server configuration\nwal_level = replica\nmax_wal_senders = 3\nwal_keep_segments = 64\n\n-- Replica server configuration\nhot_standby = on\nprimary_conninfo = 'host=primary.example.com port=5432 user=replicator'\n```\n\n### Database Security Fundamentals\n\n#### Access Control\n```sql\n-- Role-based access control\nCREATE ROLE readonly_user;\nGRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE myapp TO readonly_user;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;\n\n-- Row-level security\nCREATE POLICY user_data_policy ON users\nFOR ALL\nUSING (user_id = current_user_id());\n\n-- Column-level encryption\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;\n\n-- Encrypt sensitive data\nUPDATE users\nSET encrypted_ssn = pgp_sym_encrypt(ssn, 'encryption_key')\nWHERE ssn IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\n#### SQL Injection Prevention\n```javascript\n// Vulnerable code\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`;\n\n// Secure parameterized query\nconst mysql = require('mysql2');\nconst query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?';\nconnection.execute(query, [username], (err, results) => {\n  // Safe from SQL injection\n});\n\n// Prepared statements\nconst stmt = connection.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?');\nstmt.execute([userId], (err, results) => {\n  // Pre-compiled and safe\n});\n```",
                "notes": "### Database Design Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Naming Conventions\n- **Tables**: Use lowercase, plural nouns (users, orders, products)\n- **Columns**: Use snake_case (user_id, created_at, is_active)\n- **Primary Keys**: Use singular table name + '_id' (user_id, order_id)\n- **Foreign Keys**: Reference primary key names directly\n- **Indexes**: Use 'idx_' prefix (idx_users_email, idx_orders_date)\n\n#### 2. Data Integrity\n- **Primary Keys**: Always use surrogate keys for complex relationships\n- **Foreign Keys**: Implement referential integrity constraints\n- **Check Constraints**: Validate data at database level\n- **Triggers**: Use for complex business rules (sparingly)\n- **Transactions**: Ensure ACID properties for critical operations\n\n#### 3. Performance Optimization\n- **Indexing Strategy**: Index foreign keys and frequently queried columns\n- **Query Optimization**: Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance\n- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections efficiently\n- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis or similar for frequently accessed data\n- **Read Replicas**: Offload read operations from primary database\n\n#### 4. Scalability Considerations\n- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase server resources (CPU, RAM, storage)\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute load across multiple servers\n- **Database Sharding**: Split large tables across multiple databases\n- **Microservices**: Break monolithic databases into focused services\n- **Caching Strategies**: Implement multi-level caching (memory, Redis, CDN)\n\n### Database Evolution & Migration\n\n#### Schema Versioning\n```sql\n-- Semantic versioning for schema changes\n-- v1.0.0: Initial schema\n-- v1.1.0: Add email verification (backward compatible)\n-- v2.0.0: User authentication refactor (breaking changes)\n\n-- Migration tracking table\nCREATE TABLE schema_migrations (\n    version VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,\n    description TEXT,\n    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    success BOOLEAN DEFAULT false\n);\n```\n\n#### Migration Scripts\n```sql\n-- Up migration: Add user roles\nBEGIN;\n\nCREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'user');\n\nALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role user_role DEFAULT 'user';\n\nINSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, description, success)\nVALUES ('1.2.0', 'Add user roles system', true);\n\nCOMMIT;\n\n-- Down migration: Remove user roles\nBEGIN;\n\nALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN role;\n\nDROP TYPE user_role;\n\nDELETE FROM schema_migrations WHERE version = '1.2.0';\n\nCOMMIT;\n```",

                "notes": "### AWS Cloud Architecture Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Design for Failure\n- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Always deploy across multiple availability zones\n- **Auto Scaling**: Implement automatic scaling based on demand\n- **Health Checks**: Configure proper health checks for all services\n- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breaker patterns for resilient services\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to degrade gracefully under load\n\n#### 2. Security First Approach\n- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls\n- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions\n- **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit\n- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing\n- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant standards (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)\n\n#### 3. Cost Optimization\n- **Right Sizing**: Choose appropriate instance types and sizes\n- **Reserved Instances**: Use reserved instances for predictable workloads\n- **Spot Instances**: Leverage spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads\n- **Auto Scaling**: Scale resources based on actual demand\n- **Storage Optimization**: Use appropriate storage classes and lifecycle policies\n\n#### 4. Performance & Scalability\n- **Caching**: Implement multiple levels of caching (CloudFront, ElastiCache, DAX)\n- **CDN**: Use CloudFront for global content distribution\n- **Database Optimization**: Implement read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization\n- **Microservices**: Break monolithic applications into smaller, scalable services\n- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use serverless functions and event-driven patterns\n\n#### 5. Monitoring & Observability\n- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting\n- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for microservices\n- **CloudTrail**: Audit logging for all AWS API calls\n- **Config**: Configuration compliance and change tracking\n- **Systems Manager**: Centralized management and automation",
