Generate New Email Address
Forwarded Email Templates
Add email templates to your app by simply sending any email to this unique address. After creating a new email template in this way you can immediately view it in the dashboard, edit any necessary links and resources, and start using it right away.

If you are using an email from an external source it is strongly recommended that you change any existing links and images to point to new resources you host instead.

NOTE: only HTML emails are currently accepted - text-only emails should be created manually in the dashboard via copy and paste.
