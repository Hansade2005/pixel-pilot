            "title": "PiPilot SDK",
            "content": "The official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for PiPilot Database API provides a type-safe, developer-friendly way to interact with your PiPilot databases. Install with npm install pipilot-sdk and get started immediately with full TypeScript support, automatic rate limiting with intelligent retry logic, and comprehensive CRUD operations. The SDK handles all the complexity of API authentication, rate limit management, and error handling, allowing you to focus on building your application. Initialize the SDK with your API key and database ID: const pipilot = new PiPilot('your-api-key', 'your-database-id'). For TypeScript projects, import with full type safety: import PiPilot, { TableRecord, QueryOptions } from 'pipilot-sdk'. The SDK automatically retries failed requests due to rate limits with exponential backoff, supports up to 10,000 requests per hour, and provides real-time rate limit status monitoring. Database operations include fetchTableRecords for retrieving all records from a table, insertTableRecord for creating new records with automatic validation, updateTableRecord for modifying existing records, and deleteTableRecord for removing records. Table management features allow you to listTables with schema information and record counts, createTable with AI-generated or custom schemas, readTable for detailed table metadata, deleteTable for removing tables and all their records, and queryTable for advanced filtering, sorting, pagination, and full-text search. Authentication methods include signup for creating new user accounts, login for obtaining access and refresh tokens, verify for validating access tokens, and refresh for renewing expired tokens. File storage capabilities support uploadFile for images, PDFs, and videos up to 10MB each, with public and private file options, custom metadata, and automatic CDN delivery. The SDK includes comprehensive TypeScript support with generic TableRecord types for custom data structures, fully typed method parameters and return values, type-safe query options, and compile-time error checking. Rate limiting is handled automatically with configurable retry attempts (default: 3), exponential backoff delays, and getRateLimitStatus() for monitoring current usage. Error handling provides detailed error messages with HTTP status codes, rate limit information, and API error details. Advanced querying supports select for choosing specific columns, where and whereConditions for filtering data, orderBy for sorting results, limit and offset for pagination, search for full-text queries, and includeCount for total record counts. The SDK works seamlessly in Node.js, browser environments, and modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue. Code examples demonstrate common patterns: fetching records with const { data } = await pipilot.fetchTableRecords('table-id'), inserting with type safety using custom interfaces, updating specific fields, deleting by record ID, querying with complex filters, creating tables with schema definitions, uploading files with metadata, and managing authentication flows. Best practices include using TypeScript for type safety, defining custom interfaces for your data models, handling errors with try-catch blocks, monitoring rate limits to avoid throttling, using queryTable for complex data retrieval, and leveraging automatic retry logic for resilient applications. The SDK is actively maintained, regularly updated with new features, and includes comprehensive documentation with examples for every method. Performance optimizations include connection pooling, request batching, and efficient data serialization. Security features ensure API keys are never exposed in client-side code, all requests use HTTPS, and row-level security policies are respected. The SDK supports both CommonJS and ES modules, works with bundlers like Webpack and Vite, and includes source maps for debugging. Integration examples show how to use the SDK with popular frameworks, implement real-time data synchronization, build CRUD interfaces, and create type-safe API wrappers. The SDK's small bundle size (under 50KB minified) ensures fast load times, while tree-shaking support removes unused code. Advanced features include custom retry strategies, request interceptors, response transformers, and plugin support for extending functionality. The SDK is open source, MIT licensed, and welcomes community contributions.",
